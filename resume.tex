\section*{Profile}

\hspace{0.5cm}I'm a programmer with more than 5 years experience working at high-frequency trading companies. I was first employed at Optiver, before being recruited to join
the Statistical Arbitrage team at Susquehanna. On this very selective team, I contributed at first by working on connectivity and data processing, and later by
building my own strategies. Our key advantage on the team was a technique for building high-frequency trading strategies that required no 
trader supervision. These statistically optimised strategies were very profitable, and allowed us time for continual improvement and to develop new ideas.
While at Susquehanna, I developed a brand new strategy using machine learning techniques, which was profitable in our backtest environment.

\hspace{0.5cm}
I have a strong background in machine learning, with a PhD in Computational Linguistics and practical experience applying these methods at Susquehanna.
% I can do more than just build theoretical models though, 
I'm also a capable programmer, I've been writing code since I was a kid, and I'm well-practiced at working in modern programming environments.
This is a rare combination of skills, which I'm currently applying on a contract assignment at Google.

\item {Implemented core parts of the real-time trading and backtesting system.}
\item {Wrote networking code for market connectivity.}
\end{itemize}

% \hspace{0.5cm}In this position I worked on a specialist high-frequency trading desk that ran strategies without full-time trader supervision. This approach was very profitable, while still allowing us time to continually improve existing strategies and develop new ones. During my time there I performed analysis and optimisation using a large-scale cluster, iand employed machine learning techniques to build a brand new trading strategy. This strategy was profitable in a backtest environment, and provided many insights that were applied in other trading models.

% \hspace{0.5cm}I also worked on the trading and backtesting infrastructure, writing key improvements to the core system. This complex C++ code would be used throughtout the group environment and by all our strategies. I developed some of our connectivity code to receive tick data from the exchange, and wrote a data processing system to transform the full book tick data into key predictors that were used by the strategies.
