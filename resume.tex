% \section*{Profile}

% \hspace{0.5cm}I'm a programmer with more than 5 years experience working at high-frequency trading companies. I was first employed at Optiver, before being recruited to join
% the Statistical Arbitrage team at Susquehanna. On this very selective team, I contributed at first by working on connectivity and data processing, and later by
% building my own strategies. Our key advantage on the team was a technique for building high-frequency trading strategies that required no 
% trader supervision. These statistically optimised strategies were very profitable, and allowed us time for continual improvement and to develop new ideas.
% While at Susquehanna, I developed a brand new strategy using machine learning techniques, which was profitable in our backtest environment.

% \hspace{0.5cm}
% I have a strong background in machine learning, with a PhD in Computational Linguistics and practical experience applying these methods at Susquehanna.
% % I can do more than just build theoretical models though, 
% I'm also a capable programmer, I've been writing code since I was a kid, and I'm well-practiced at working in modern programming environments.
% This is a rare combination of skills, which I'm currently applying on a contract assignment at Google.

\vspace{0.05cm}
\hspace{0.5cm} I'm currently working in the Text-To-Speech (TTS) team, developing a major new voice for Google's production systems. This involves preparing data for the recording process, and ensuring the quality of lines synthesised by the voice. My work on this new voice has resulted in measurably improved performance on the lines that are most important to our users.

\hspace{0.5cm} A key achievement during my time here has been to automate many tasks that were previously done manually. The team has multiple data sources that need to be kept synchronised, and removing the repetitive human effort to do so is a great help for many people on the TTS team.

\hspace{0.5cm} I have gained a lot of experience working with Google technology in this position. I work extensively with BigTables, both programmatically and from the command line. I have written many unit tests with the gUnit framework; in one instance I reduced test time by so much that a ``long" timeout could be removed.
% Finally, the many CLs I have submitted demonstrate that I can contribute at Google.

\vspace{0.05cm}
\hspace{0.5cm} I worked on a specialist high-frequency trading desk that ran strategies without full-time trader supervision. During my time there I developed and optimised a brand new trading strategy that was profitable in a backtest environment. My strategy also provided many insights that were applied in other trading models.

\hspace{0.5cm}I also worked on the trading and backtesting infrastructure, writing key improvements to the core system. This complex C++ code would be used throughout the group environment and by all our strategies. I developed connectivity code to receive tick data from the exchange, and wrote a data processing system to transform the full book tick data into key predictors that were used by the trading strategies.

\hspace{0.5cm} I worked on an entity linking system that automatically generated content pages from newspaper articles. My key contribution in this position was to design and implement a new database schema to store all the information extracted from our corpus. The system has now been deployed by Fairfax Media, one of the largest media companies in Australia.

\hspace{0.5cm} I lectured a Natural Language Processing course and supervised students.

\vspace{0.05cm}
\hspace{0.5cm} I managed a data capture and analysis system distributed across multiple geographic locations that processed huge volumes of data. The system provided sub-microsecond timing information on our trading strategies, letting the company know where it was most valuable to spend programmer effort.

\hspace{0.5cm} I also worked on a specialised high-frequency trading strategy, increasing the profit that it made.
